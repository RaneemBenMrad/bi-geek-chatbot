 Note: This repository does not contain the full codebase due to GitHub limitations when pushing large folders.

Instead, I created this clean version that includes the core files and structure of the project.

For context, the full version included larger directories such as data, outputs, and model checkpoints that could not be pushed. You can refer to the screenshots for a glimpse of the complete project structure
